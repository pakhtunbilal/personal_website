            I started designing in the final year of my B.com degree.
            One day my best friend told me about the awesome job offered to her a by company but she did not join.
            so I was like " If it was me, I would have accepted this".
            Then she said "Let's get you one". <br /> <br /><br />
            I’ve approached my career since then with a similar amount of vigour.
            always seeking to learn, understand, and evolve.
            I find joy in the process of piecing together small parts of the built world.
            Guided by her, I am now a "Full Stack Web Developer".
            She helped me all the way to it.

            When I’m not designing, you can find me hitting my head with iron in the gym, flexing in every mirror I pass by, swimming, or exploring new places.
            Past episodes have included searching for the perfect t-shirt, trying to keep my spin straight during hours of coding, and much more.
            Feel free to ask, and I’ll fill you in on the featured selection. <br /><br /><br />
            I had to leave my small hometown Sikar, Rajasthan, due to a lack of IT opportunities.
            but currently based in Pune, Maharashtra.
